## Contribution / Development

When you are about to work on a new feature, a patch, or are going to be editing more than just a line or two, our protocol is to create a new branch as your editing "sandbox" and we will deal with merge conflicts while merging branches as a team instead of while committing. Feel free to create as many branches as you want for yourself to work with as long as the namespace isn't crowded up and merging to master doesn't become a chore.
